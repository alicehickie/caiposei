The seating and dining area seem outdated. It's like going into an old Italian-themed restaurant, but you can tell that the interior is well worn. Beer: they sell some decent selection. Pizza:…. 
Lido Comes From an Italian Resort. The original Lido is a beach resort near Venice, Italy. The town’s name comes from the Italian word lido, which means "shore" or "bank."(The Italian root derives from litus, the Latin word for "shore.")By the mid-19th century, Lido’s reputation as a chic vacation destination for the well-to-do made it the envy of seaside resorts everywhere.  Our traditional thin crust pizza is made with our unique blend of cheeses, zesty sauce and topped with your favorite ingredients. Includes a complimentary plate of hors d' oeuvres (Dine-In Only).

I know that the Baratza Encore gets recommended often around here, but tell me: Is the price tag really worth it for the casual coffee drinker? I have a Hario Mini Mill right now and it gets the job done, but I've been using it the night before to save time in the morning. I'd really like to be able to quickly grind my one cup of beans before I brew. If it makes any difference, I'm also looking to buy an Aeropress. Thanks! I have to say I haven't abandoned the Keurig yet but my coffee is alrea. Ledo Pizza Handcrafted Menu. Ledo Pizza is Square Because Ledo Pizza Never Cuts Corners. Pizzas, Subs, Sandwiches, Salads, and Pastas. Talk about your day. Anything goes, but subreddit rules still apply. Please be polite to each other. I did the ~~m3~~ M2 (virtuoso) burr upgrade a month or two ago, and immediately started having a ton of fines. I only replaced the lower burr, because I had read many times that that was the only step needed. I waited for a settling in period, but things never improved. I ran through the Baratza grind consistency trouble shooting video and it seemed everything was okay. What tipped me onto needing additional replacement stuff, was using my brother's Encore and noticing that the grind change. 
Since Avengers Endgame has arrived in theaters, I shall volunteer to list out the biggest screens accompanied with the best surround sound  I hope there are still seats left for you (can be used for future blockbusters too!!) (not including IMAX) amp#x200B; This is not according to order amp#x200B; 1. GV VivoCity Max Hall 1 - Dolby Atmos/Surround 7.1, Dual 4k Projection 2. Shaw Theaters Lido Hall 1 - Dolby Surround 7.1 3. Shaw Theaters Lido Hall 4 - Dolby Surround 7.1 4. The Grand. A few months ago I decided it was time to step up my grinder game. Prior to that I was using a Hario Skerton 1 (https://imgur.com/88IgGJE) (Right). For  it did an admirable job as a gateway into the world of fresh-ground coffee but grind consistency was an issue 2 (https://imgur.com/XSjWibM). I was hoping to be at or under a 0 USD price point. After reading numerous posts here and watching video reviews I was stuck between the Orphan Espresso Lido E-T and the Comandante Issue I'm having: I can never tell what grind I'll get when I adjust it, so I cannot figure out the correct position for espresso, its always to coarse 
I already have an electric pot to heat the water so I'm all set there. And I already own an Aeropress so that's been eliminated from this process. My grinder is a cheap one so that can use an upgrade. Here's my initial plan: - Lido ET 5.00 - Hario V60 Drip Coffee Scale and Timer .00 ~~- Hardio V60 Glass Cofee Dripper (size 01) .50~~ Replaced with plastic version starter set. Also changed to size 02. .96 ~~- Hario V60 Clear Glass Range Coffee Server (360 ml) .21~~ Included. I'm currently trying to decide between Baratza Virtuoso, Kimu M47 Traveler and Commandante C40 MK3. My main intrest is quality, consistency and durability? Also how do M47 and C40 grind speeds compare. I've been using Netflix for language practice but the controls are too clunky for constant pausing and going forwards/backwards. At this point I'm considering buying an external DVD-drive and buying movies just to be able to play them in VLC. Is there a better way of finding content? Most of these free streaming sites don't provide Thai subs and I haven't been able to find any decent Thai torrent sites either. I'd be happy to stay with Netflix if the controls (and buffering) weren't French Cath vs. Yankauer Honestly don't listen to a ton of hip hop, but I gotta say some of SYRE just blows me away. Really dig stuff like B.L.U.E. and especially tracks like Ninety, Lost Boy, Fallen, and even Batman. I'd appreciate any albums with similar sounds/production, or just some shit you think i might. 
I recently sold my Aergrind to move to something more consistent and basically now I have two options: Kinu Traveler(~0 shipped) or Lido 3(or ET or whatever, about 0 shipped). Fifty bucks are not much of a deal at that price point but I would rather buy the grinder to end it all. Perharps someone out there had both of them and can chime in and help me to decide? Is Kinu better built and aligned? Is Lido less cumbersome to operate? I rarely brought my grinder with me to work or travel. Hey, I'm curious if anyone has one of these and what their experience has been. I find that there's quite a bit that appeals to me about this grinder. The durability of it (I wouldn't be afraid to break or scratch it), the hopper size (not that I would regularly grind 100g of coffee but it's nice knowing I can), the simplicity of it and the ability to easily clean it as well as the easy adjustments for grind settings and lastly the price. It seems to be in this nice middle ground between lower. I am currently stuck. I want to buy a hand coffee grinder but I don’t know which one: The Hario skerton, Hario Slim, Porlex Tall or short or the Rhinowares hand grinder? I honestly cant decide as I need something that can do a wide array so which one do you guys recommend. </p>
